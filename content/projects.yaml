  text: Graceful Shoveler is a mock (albeit functional to an extent) eCommerce site built in just over a week - I was responsible for developing server-side logic for maintaining user sessions and a persistent user/guest cart using Express.js and PostgreSQL. In addition, I developed components with React and pure CSS including a landing page with parallax scrolling done by hand. Tying it off, I seeded our database with real shovel and 'shovel-like' products from Home Depot.

  text: Digin is my first 'foot in the water' experince with web scraping; in this case I created a crawler to scrape Home Depot for their shovel data and shovel-like product data. Using a Queue I was able to enqueue requests using cheeriojs, determine if it was a page to enqueue links or to scrape data, and write the relevant data to my file system using node.
